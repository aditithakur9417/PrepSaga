          "Recruiter can contact the candidate based on his/her profiles on Linkedin etc or if any of his/her known has referred him/her to the company. However, it’s always best to message the recruiters via linkedin and apply for the roles in the Career page of Google. If the candidate is good in DS & Algo skills it is highly recommended that he/she participate in Google Kickstart, this is Google’s hiring contest which happens 6 times in a year. If the performance in those competitions is good the recruiters will contact you easily.",
        interview_rounds:
          "Google has a total of 7 rounds. First two are telephonic interviews where the interviewer mostly asks one medium or two easy Algo DS problems to the candidate and the candidate has 45 minutes to solve the problems. However if the performance in Kickstart is good, these rounds are skipped and you directly move to the next rounds. Next we have 5 onsite interviews out of which 4 are Algo DS interviews and 1 is Googliness interview, Googliness interview is mostly a behavioral interview.",

          " Once the interviews are over, the recruiter will contact you with the feedback of the interviews, if the performance is good and the interviews are cleared your profile goes to the different teams in Google for the team matching round. In the team matching round the team understands your work style and your interests and you can understand their requirements and the work expectations of the team.",

(Suggestion: Practice writing the code on google doc if you have any interview coming up as it is a different experience compared to writing the code in any text editor).",
